<h1 align="center">463 Final Project - MindfulMe</h1>

# ***Goal of the Project (5%)***
+ The goal of this project was to create a web application that users can use for three different features that is displayed on a menu after they login to their account.:
  + Stressometer - Answer a questionaire about their emotions, stress levels, happiness, etc.
  + Journaling - They can use this option to journal about anything they want to just write down which they can access again by just signing into their account.
  + Good News - There are four categories of articles - Animals, Inspiring, Nature, and Laughs - that users can choose from. Once they choose a category, they can randomly generate an article for them to read. 

# ***Significance of the Project (10%)***
+ We wanted to develop this application as a try towards having a resource that people can use for their emotional/mental benefit. Life can be very stressful or many things can happen in life that can bring down a person's mood. There are a lot of resources out there that people can use but we wanted to create an application that combines three good resources out there for support; a stressometer, journaling, and good news. Stressometer is a great way for someone to express how they are feeling without having to write much. Sometimes it can be hard to write down our thoughts so this helps people to just rate how they are feeling and based on that get some advice back. Sometimes being told the simplest advice can help people deal with their problems. The journaling feature can help people write down their thoughts and nobody but them will be able to see it and once they log back in they can re-visit their entries and use that as a way to see how far they have come. Last but not least our good new generator is a simple way to bring some joy into someone's life. Just reading about some of the good in the world or reading cute stories about animals can help people take their minds off of things.
